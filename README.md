# Ruby Practice

This repository is a compilation of the lectures and execises on Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

All the information on Ruby within this repo was taken from the Giraffe Academy course that can be enjoyed in full on this [4-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY) thanks to the [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) YouTube channel.

The files have been commented with helpful information on how methods work and it can be used specially by any developer that comes from JavaScript as it is a recurring point of reference in these files.

All the Ruby on Rails projects were created following [this udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)
