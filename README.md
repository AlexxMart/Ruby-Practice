# Ruby Practice

This repository is a compilation of the lectures and execises on Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

All the information on this repo was taken from the Giraffe Academy course that can be watched in full on this [4-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY) thanks to the [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) YouTube channel.

The section for Ruby on Rails is thanks to [this guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) found in the Rails' official website.

The files have been commented with helpful information on how things work and it can be used specially by any developer that comes from JavaScript as it is a recurring point of reference in these files.
